Exercises (HW): Cryptography, key exchange protocols, and Python 3
Group work: Read the materials and finish the exercises
Submission: after the 1st Lab to email khanh@hcmut.edu.vn

Question 1 (50 marks): Write “Python 3” program(s) to perform the following tasks:
A. Compute the prime factors of a given natural number. (10 marks)
B. Implement Caesar cipher system with a given “shift step number”: (40 marks)

Question 2 (50 marks):
Write a “Python 3” program to simulate and teach people how “Diffie-Hellman key exchange
protocol” works?.
Reminder: Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets. They start with
prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public keys, and then generate a
shared secret key
